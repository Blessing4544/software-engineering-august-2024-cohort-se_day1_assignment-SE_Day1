#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
The importance in the technology industry is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare which meets users/customers needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer
The first one is the development of programming languages(e.g Fortan), 
The second one is the advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The third one is the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer
Lists of the phrases of software development life cycle are Requirements, Design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Explanation is below:
 1. Requirements - gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements.
 2. Design - creating high level and detailed designs 
 3. Implementation - for writing codes and building the software account to design specifications.
 4. Testing - conducting various tests
 5. Deployment - releasing the software to users.
 6. Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancement to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer
Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phrases (e.g requirements, design, implementation) flowing downward like a waterfall.
Agile methodology is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Here are examples of scenarios where Waterfall and Agile methodologies would be appropriate:

Waterfall Methodology:
1. Construction projects: Building a house, road, or bridge requires a linear, phase-by-phase approach.
2. Government contracting: Strict regulations and bidding processes require a predictable, plan-driven approach.
3. Safety-critical systems: Development of life-critical systems (e.g., medical devices, aircraft control systems) demands rigorous planning and testing.
4. Well-defined software projects: Simple, well-understood software applications with fixed requirements (e.g., calculator app).
5. Manufacturing: Production lines with standardized processes benefit from a sequential approach.

Agile Methodology:
1. Software product development: Complex, innovative software products (e.g., mobile apps, SaaS solutions) requiring rapid iteration.
2. Research and development: Exploratory projects with uncertain outcomes benefit from iterative experimentation.
3. E-commerce and digital marketing: Fast-paced, competitive environments require adaptability and rapid response.
4. Startup environments: Agile helps startups quickly validate assumptions and pivot.
5. Complex system integration: Integrating multiple systems or technologies with uncertain interactions.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer
Here's a detailed description of the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, Quality Assurance Engineer, and Project Manager in a software engineering team:
Software Developer: There are responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: They ensure software quality by developing and executing test plans.
Project Manger: They oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer
Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes. Examples are Visual Studios and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordinates work among team members. Examples are Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer
1. Changing requirements - requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
 2. Tight deadlines - pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed developments and comprised quality.
 3. Technical debt - accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debts can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
The strategies for overcoming these challenges are:
 1. Effective communication 
 2. Agile methodologies 
 3. Prioritization of taste
 4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer
Unit testing are responsible for testing individual components or modules of software. 
Integration testing are responsible for testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing is responsible for testing the software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing is responsible for testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer 
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps to avoid getting confusing answers from AI models by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer 
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about culture."
Improved Prompt:
"Tell me all about the history of the igbo culture, their background, and traditions. It should be dated from the 1960s to date."

Why the improved prompt is more effective:
1. Specificity: Clearly defines a particular culture I desire to know about.
2. Context: Provides essential background information.
3. Requirements: Lists key features (responsive, CMS, portfolio).
4. Timeline: Establishes a realistic deadline (1960s to 2024).
5. Deliverables: Specifies the expected outcome (functional prototype).
